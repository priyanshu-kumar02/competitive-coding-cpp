Ques: set<unsigned int,double> ...how to order set based on second element

Solution:

You should use the comparator:

struct Cmp
{
    bool operator ()(const pair<unsigned int, double> &a, const pair<unsigned int, double> &b)
    {
        return a.second < b.second;
    }
};
and then you can define your set like:

set <pair<unsigned int, double>, Cmp> your_set;
